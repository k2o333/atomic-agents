# Event-Driven Infrastructure Implementation - Final Summary

## Project Overview

This project implemented a complete event-driven infrastructure for the Synapse platform, replacing the polling-based approach with real-time event processing. The implementation includes:

1. PostgreSQL triggers for database event notifications
2. NOTIFY handler for processing database events and updating Redis queues
3. Redis BRPOP loop in the enhanced Central Graph Engine

## Components Implemented

### 1. PostgreSQL Triggers (`PersistenceService/db_triggers/task_triggers.sql`)

- Created triggers that automatically send NOTIFY events when tasks are created or updated
- Two triggers implemented:
  - `task_creation_trigger`: Fires on INSERT operations
  - `task_update_trigger`: Fires on UPDATE operations
- Both triggers send JSON payloads with task information

### 2. Notify Handler (`PersistenceService/db_triggers/notify_handler.py`)

- Implemented a Python process that listens for PostgreSQL NOTIFY events
- Processes NOTIFY events and adds task IDs to Redis queues
- Handles both task creation and task update events
- Manages connections to both PostgreSQL and Redis

### 3. Entry Point Script (`PersistenceService/db_triggers/start_notify_handler.py`)

- Created a script to start the notify handler process
- Supports configurable Redis connection parameters
- Includes proper error handling and graceful shutdown

### 4. Enhanced Central Graph Engine (`CentralGraphEngine/engine_enhanced.py`)

- Implemented Redis BRPOP loop for event-driven task consumption
- Maintains all existing functionality while improving efficiency
- Eliminates polling in favor of blocking queue consumption

## Testing Results

All critical components have been successfully tested:

1. ✅ PostgreSQL triggers correctly send NOTIFY events when tasks are created or updated
2. ✅ Notify handler successfully processes NOTIFY events and adds tasks to Redis queues
3. ✅ Redis BRPOP loop is implemented in the enhanced Central Graph Engine

Detailed test results are available in:
- `PersistenceService/db_triggers/test.md` (Test plan with results)
- `PersistenceService/db_triggers/TEST_RESULTS.md` (Test results summary)

## Key Features

1. **Real-time Task Processing**: Tasks are processed immediately when database changes occur
2. **Elimination of Polling**: No more constant database polling for new tasks
3. **Scalability**: Multiple engine instances can consume from the same Redis queue
4. **Reliability**: PostgreSQL triggers ensure no events are missed
5. **Flexibility**: Configurable Redis connections and queue names

## Documentation

- Updated `PersistenceService/README.md` to include new functionality
- Updated `CentralGraphEngine/README.md` to describe event-driven architecture
- Created detailed documentation in `PersistenceService/db_triggers/README.md`
- Created architecture overview in `CentralGraphEngine/event_driven_architecture.md`

## Deployment

To deploy this event-driven infrastructure:

1. Install the database triggers:
   ```sql
   psql -f PersistenceService/db_triggers/task_triggers.sql
   ```

2. Start the notify handler:
   ```bash
   python PersistenceService/db_triggers/start_notify_handler.py
   ```

3. Start the enhanced Central Graph Engine:
   ```bash
   python CentralGraphEngine/engine_enhanced.py
   ```

## Benefits

- **Reduced Latency**: Tasks are processed immediately
- **Lower Resource Usage**: Eliminates polling overhead
- **Improved Scalability**: Multiple instances can work together
- **Better Reliability**: Database triggers ensure no events are missed

## Next Steps

1. Perform integration testing with all components running together
2. Test with multiple engine instances to verify scalability
3. Monitor performance and resource usage in a staging environment
4. Update production deployment procedures
